# Elderly care Project

This web app manage a group of assets information and show stats to allow carers to monitor the elderly status.
This assets are:
- A smart bracelet. (GPS, fall sensor, panic button...)
- A static video camera.

The app is made with AngularJS (v1.3) and Ruby (v2.1.3) on Rails (v4.1.8).  The AngularJS file structures and some other patterns are based on the great [Angular Style Guide by John Papa] [angularStyleGuide].

AngularJS Tests are made with [Karma][karmaWeb] and you can run them typing:

```sh
$  rake karma:run
```
