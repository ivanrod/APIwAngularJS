# Elderly care Project

This web app manage a group of assets information and show stats to allow carers to monitor the elderly status.
This assets are:
- A smart bracelet. (GPS, fall sensor, panic button...)

The app is made with:
- AngularJS (v1.3), 
- Foundation (v5), 
- Foundation for apps, 
- Ruby (v2.1.3), 
- Ruby on Rails (v4.1.8)

Other great libraries used that you can see in *vendor* files:
- Chartjs and Angular-chart. To create awesome charts.
- Google maps and Angular-google maps. To see realtime position of the assets.
